# Mini pixelart editor

ðŸš§ Still very WIP

The goal of this tool is to work as a simple pixelart editor that works with a limited palette and compresses the art projects into short strings. This tool is intended to be used in projects with size constraints, namely the js13k game jam.

[Try it out](https://lopis.github.io/mini-pixelart-editor/)

## Development

This project is written in plain HTML/JS/CSS and has no build steps.

If you have python installed, you can run `yarn dev` to start an HTTP server in port 3000. Otherwise, simple open the `index.html` file directly in your browser.
