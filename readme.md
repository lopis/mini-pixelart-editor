# Mini pixelart editor

ðŸš§ Still very WIP

The goal of this tool is to work as a simple pixelart editor that works with a limited palette and compresses the art projects into short strings. This tool is intended to be used in projects with size constraints, namely the js13k game jam.

The original inspiration for this project cam from a similar tool made by @xem called [miniPixelArt](https://xem.github.io/miniPixelArt/). I wanted to extend its capabilities and make it more usable, as well as make it export more readable code.

## Development

This project is written in plain HTML/JS/CSS and has no build steps.

If you have python installed, you can run `yarn dev` to start an HTTP server in port 3000. Otherwise, simple open the `index.html` file directly in your browser.
